# Bachelorarbeit: Comparison of Data Preprocessing techniques for an efficiency Signal Peptide-Protein classifier in Gram-Positive Bacteria

For this work, five different binary classifiers were built and evaluated based on existing data gathered from various protein secretion studies in Gram-positive bacteria. A successful classification was pursued considering the complexity and structure of the dataset. To build proper classification models, specific technical factors were taken into account, e.g., the imbalanced nature of the data (higher fraction of inefficient samples compared to available efficient signal peptide-protein pairs), and the high-dimensionality of the available features that could be attributed to each sample. These factors were also relevant for the model evaluation stage and the proper choosing of performance metrics for further model comparison.

Each file contains the script for the performance evaluation of the five models, while applying the different preprocessing techniques.
